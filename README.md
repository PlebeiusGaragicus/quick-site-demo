# quick-site-demo

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR HUMANS:

**In order to "vibe code" this web application to life...**

1. Run `node --version` to verify you have Node.js on your dev computer.
1. Fully read and flesh out this README file (take this seriously and be descriptive)
1. Use a prompt like the following to start off your agent:

```txt
Review README.md in order to understand this repo - then build a plan to begin building.
```

1. Use Claude Code's PLAN mode to kick the process off and *anytime* you start from fresh context.

1. Use Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking. **Use state-of-the-art models and methods to get state-of-the-art results.**  Vibing can be a terrible and frustrating experience with out-dated technology from just 9 months ago.

1. Consider using a more-appropriate IDE, like Cursor - See https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor for latest features especially built for things like web design.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS:

This repository is for a Svelte 5 web app meant to be build with GitHub Actions and published on GitHub Pages and has the following requirements:

- It should work as an SPA, with hash-based routing.
- It should include a 404.html which will re-route a user back to the homepage.
- It should be entirely client-side (no SSR)

The agent's job is to take lead on the design, implementation, devops, and repository maintenance for this project as it is iteratively build with human developer team feedback.
